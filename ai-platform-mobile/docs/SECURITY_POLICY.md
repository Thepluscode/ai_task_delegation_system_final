# AutomatedAI Platform Security Policy

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the security policy for the AutomatedAI Platform mobile application. It establishes the security standards, classifications, and procedures to be followed by all stakeholders including developers, administrators, and end users.

## 2. Security Classification System

### 2.1 Classification Levels

The AutomatedAI Platform employs a five-tier security classification system:

| Classification | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| PUBLIC | Information that can be freely shared with the public. No security implications if disclosed. |
| INTERNAL | Information intended for internal use only. Minimal security impact if disclosed. |
| CONFIDENTIAL | Sensitive information that should be restricted to authorized personnel. Moderate security impact if disclosed. |
| RESTRICTED | Highly sensitive information with strict access controls. Significant security impact if disclosed. |
| TOP_SECRET | Critical information with the highest security restrictions. Severe security impact if disclosed. |

### 2.2 Data Classification Guidelines

- **PUBLIC**: Marketing materials, public APIs, documentation for public features
- **INTERNAL**: Internal reports, operational statistics, non-sensitive telemetry data
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: Customer data, configuration details, network topology
- **RESTRICTED**: Security controls, authentication mechanisms, encryption keys
- **TOP_SECRET**: Proprietary algorithms, security vulnerabilities, critical system credentials

## 3. Access Control Policy

### 3.1 Authentication Requirements

- Multi-factor authentication required for CONFIDENTIAL access and above
- Strong password requirements enforced for all users
- Biometric authentication used where available
- Session timeout set to 15 minutes of inactivity

### 3.2 Authorization Matrix

| Role | PUBLIC | INTERNAL | CONFIDENTIAL | RESTRICTED | TOP_SECRET |
|------|--------|----------|--------------|------------|------------|
| Viewer | ✓ | ✓ | - | - | - |
| Operator | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | - | - |
| Administrator | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| Security Officer | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### 3.3 Principle of Least Privilege

All users and processes must operate with the minimum privileges necessary to perform their functions. Access rights are reviewed quarterly.

## 4. Communication Security

### 4.1 Secure Communication Channels

- All API communications must use TLS 1.3+
- WebSocket connections must implement secure WebSocket protocol (wss://)
- All data transfers must be encrypted in transit
- Certificate pinning implemented for critical endpoints

### 4.2 Data Encryption Requirements

- All data classified as CONFIDENTIAL and above must be encrypted at rest
- AES-256 encryption required for stored sensitive data
- End-to-end encryption for all RESTRICTED and TOP_SECRET data
- Encryption keys must be rotated every 90 days

## 5. Mobile Device Security

### 5.1 Device Requirements

- Device encryption must be enabled
- Automatic screen lock required (maximum 5 minutes)
- Remote wipe capability must be enabled
- Latest security patches must be installed

### 5.2 Application Security Controls

- Local data stored in secure enclave where available
- Jailbreak/root detection implemented
- Screenshot prevention for sensitive screens
- Secure clipboard handling for sensitive data

## 6. Robot Control Security

### 6.1 Command Authorization

- All robot commands must be authenticated and authorized
- Critical commands (shutdown, restart, quarantine) require additional verification
- Command audit logs maintained for all operations
- Commands with security classification of RESTRICTED or above require security officer approval

### 6.2 Telemetry Security

- Telemetry data must be classified according to sensitivity
- All telemetry transmissions must be encrypted
- Anomalous telemetry patterns trigger security alerts
- Data retention policies enforced based on classification

## 7. Compliance Requirements

### 7.1 Supported Frameworks

The platform enforces compliance with the following frameworks as applicable:

- ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)
- IEC 62443 (Industrial Control Security)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- SOC 2 (Service Organization Control)
- HIPAA (Healthcare Privacy)
- GDPR (Data Protection)
- PCI-DSS (Payment Card Security)

### 7.2 Compliance Monitoring

- Automated compliance checks performed daily
- Compliance reports generated monthly
- Non-compliance issues escalated to security team
- Compliance dashboard available for real-time status

## 8. Security Incident Response

### 8.1 Incident Classification

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Escalation |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Critical | System breach, data exfiltration | Immediate | CISO, CTO |
| High | Targeted attack, significant vulnerability | < 1 hour | Security Team Lead |
| Medium | Suspicious activity, potential vulnerability | < 8 hours | Security Analyst |
| Low | Minor policy violation | < 24 hours | Team Lead |

### 8.2 Incident Response Procedure

1. **Identification**: Detect and document the security incident
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage
3. **Eradication**: Remove the threat from the environment
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document findings and implement preventive measures

## 9. Security Update Process

- Critical security patches applied within 24 hours
- Security updates tested in staging environment before deployment
- Emergency update process defined for zero-day vulnerabilities
- Security update compliance monitored and enforced

## 10. Audit and Logging

### 10.1 Required Logging

- All authentication attempts (successful and failed)
- All authorization decisions
- All security-relevant configuration changes
- All access to CONFIDENTIAL data and above
- All robot command executions

### 10.2 Log Management

- Logs must be stored for a minimum of 1 year
- Logs must be tamper-resistant and encrypted
- Automated log analysis for security events
- Log access restricted to authorized personnel

## 11. Security Governance

- Security policies reviewed quarterly
- Security training mandatory for all personnel
- Penetration testing conducted bi-annually
- Third-party security audits performed annually
